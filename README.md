Get hands-on experience debugging Go programs using Delve, the Go debugger. The course is meant for developers who are already experienced and comfortable writing Go programs who want to be able to debug those programs when something goes wrong. Instructor Derek Parker first helps you master usage of Delve at the command line and within Visual Studio Code, and then shows you how to build on that in order to debug increasingly complex problems. Take this course to gain practical knowledge of Delve and how to use a debugger effectively for root cause analysis.
